			<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
	
		BACKGROUND
			<div class="fragment">
			
		<ol>
			<li> <b>Power factor </b>  is 
				 the ratio of the real power absorbed by the load to the apparent power flowing in the circuit,
				 and is a dimensionless number in the closed interval of <b>−1 to 1.</b>
			</li>
			<li>Usually lagging(inductive) and sometimes leading(capacitive) according to load.

			</li>
			<li>Higher PF is preferred due its several advantages.

			</li>
			
		</ol>
	</div>
	</section>
	<section>
		ORIGIN OF  LOW POWER FACTOR
		<ul>
			<li>To perform useful work by active power, reactive power is required.  </li>
			<li>Inductive loads like motors draw reactive power to maintain magnetic fields
			</li>
			

		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
		PROBLEM STATEMENT
		<ul>
			<li>Low pf causes inefficient use of power
			</li>
			<li>Systems with low pf draw higher current
			</li>
			<li>This causes higher losses, damage of equipments, greater financial losses to utilities and higher charges to customers.
			</li>
			<li>Power factor correction systems have to be applied with low cost, fast response and reliability
			</li>
			<li>Existing systems are less convenient, with slow response to varying load conditions and less controllable 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
			OBJECTIVE
			<div class="fragment">
				<ol>
					<li>To improve the power factor to enhance the power quality of a line
					</li>
					<li>To optimize the operation of SVC at domestic level. 
					</li>
					<li>To maintain the unity power factor of loads mainly inductive. </li>
					
				</ol>

		<h3>LITERATURE REVIEW </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The traditional power factor improvement techniques used are capacitor banks, synchronous condensors and phase advancers
			</li>
		
			<li>Fctcr is one of the FACTS technologies for the controllable var generation
			</li>
			<li>Thus can be used for pf improvement under varying load conditions and voltage regulation
			</li>
		</ul>

		LITERATURE REVIEW ..
		<ul>
			<li>FC-TCR
			</li>
			<li>reactance connected in series with a bidirectional thyristor valve. 
			</li>
			<li>The thyristor valve is phase-controlled, which allows the value of delivered reactive power to be adjusted to meet varying system conditions.  
			</li>
		
			<li>Narain G. Hingorani and Laszlo Gyugyi  pioneered the concept and invented several FACTS controllers including FC-TCR

		   <h3> CONCLUSION</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Variation of reactive power with firing angle was studied
					</li>
					<li>Reactive power consumed by inductive loads was compensated by FCTCR
					</li>
					<li>Power factor was improved continuously for dynamic loads
						Approximately to unity.
						
						</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>LIMITATIONS</h3>
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Our project only deals with inductive loads</li>
			<li>Chances of misfiring of tcr which requires extra tsc circuits and control mechanism would be complex
			</li>
		</ol>

			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>FUTURE SCOPE</h3>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Can be used for controlling of reactive power for leading loads
	</li>
	
     <li>Can be monitored remotely.</li>
</ul>
